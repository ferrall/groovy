# Groovy 🥁

Modern drum notation editor and player with clean separation of core logic and UI.

## Architecture Principles

This project is built with **strict separation of concerns**:

- **Core Logic** (`src/core/`) - Framework-agnostic engine for drum playback, timing, and audio
- **UI Layer** (`src/components/`, `src/App.tsx`) - React-based user interface
- **Adapter Layer** (`src/hooks/`) - Bridges core logic and React

The core engine has **ZERO dependencies** on React or any UI framework, making it:
- ✅ Easy to test without UI
- ✅ Reusable with any framework (React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JS)
- ✅ Future-proof (UI can be completely replaced)

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
# Development build
npm run build

# Production build (for deployment)
npm run build:prod
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview:prod
```

Open [http://localhost:4173/scribe2/](http://localhost:4173/scribe2/) in your browser.

### Type Check

```bash
npm run type-check
```

## Deployment

The app is configured to deploy to `/scribe2/` subdirectory by default.

### Quick Deploy

```bash
# 1. Build for production
npm run build:prod

# 2. Upload dist/ contents to server
# See DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed instructions
```

### Change Deployment Path

To deploy to a different subdirectory or root:

1. Edit `vite.config.ts`
2. Change `PRODUCTION_BASE_PATH` constant
3. Rebuild with `npm run build:prod`

See `CHANGE_BASE_PATH.md` for detailed instructions.

## Core Engine API

The core engine is completely independent of React:

```typescript
import { GrooveEngine } from './core';

// Create engine
const engine = new GrooveEngine();

// Subscribe to events
engine.on('positionChange', (position) => {
  console.log('Current position:', position);
});

engine.on('playbackStateChange', (isPlaying) => {
  console.log('Playing:', isPlaying);
});

// Start playback
await engine.play(groove, true);

// Stop playback
engine.stop();

// Update groove during playback (applies on next loop)
engine.updateGroove(newGroove);

// Preview a drum sound
await engine.playPreview('kick');

// Clean up
engine.dispose();
```

- [ ] Multi-measure support
- [ ] Velocity control
- [ ] Articulations (accents, ghost notes, flams)
- [ ] Undo/redo

### Phase 4: Notation & Export

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **Web Audio API** - Audio synthesis and playback

## Design Philosophy

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Core logic is completely independent of UI
2. **Event-Based Communication** - Core emits events, UI listens
3. **Framework Agnostic** - Core can work with any framework
4. **Test-Driven** - Core logic can be tested without UI
5. **Future-Proof** - UI can be replaced without touching core
